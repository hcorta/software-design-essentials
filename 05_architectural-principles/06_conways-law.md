# Conway's Law

Conway's law is a principle in software development that states that the structure of a system will reflect the structure of the organization that builds it. This means that the design of a software system will reflect the communication patterns, organizational structure, and decision-making processes of the team that develops it.

Conway's law is based on the idea that the design of a software system is a social and organizational process, rather than a purely technical process. When a team of developers works on a software project, they must communicate, collaborate, and make decisions together in order to produce the desired design. These social and organizational processes will shape the design of the system, and they will be reflected in the structure of the system itself.

For example, if a team is organized into small, independent teams that communicate and collaborate effectively, then the resulting software system is likely to be modular and highly cohesive. The individual modules or components of the system will be well-defined and independent, and they will be able to work together seamlessly to provide the desired functionality.

On the other hand, if a team is organized into large, hierarchical teams that have poor communication and collaboration, then the resulting software system is likely to be monolithic and tightly coupled. The individual modules or components of the system will be poorly defined and interdependent, and they will be difficult to maintain and evolve over time.

Therefore, Conway's law suggests that the structure of a software system is a reflection of the structure of the team that develops it. By understanding and managing the social and organizational processes of a team, we can improve the design of the resulting software system.
