# Common Closure Principle (CCP)

The common closure principle is a software design principle that states that modules or components that are closely related or that frequently change together should be grouped into the same unit of encapsulation. This means that related components should be placed in the same module, class, or package, so that they can be easily maintained, modified, and released together.

Here is an example of the common closure principle in TypeScript:

```typescript
// A module for managing user accounts

// A class for representing a user
export class User {
  constructor(public username: string, public password: string) {}

  // ...
}

// A class for managing user authentication
export class UserAuth {
  // Check if a username and password match
  public static checkCredentials(username: string, password: string): boolean {
    // ...
  }

  // Hash a password for storage
  public static hashPassword(password: string): string {
    // ...
  }
}

// A class for managing user sessions
export class UserSession {
  // Start a new user session
  public static start(user: User): string {
    // ...
  }

  // Check if a session is valid
  public static check(sessionId: string): boolean {
    // ...
  }

  // End a user session
  public static end(sessionId: string) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

In this example, the User, UserAuth, and UserSession classes are closely related and they often change together (e.g. when adding new authentication methods or session management features). Therefore, they are grouped into the same UserModule, which makes it easy to maintain, modify, and release all of these classes together. This also makes it easier for other parts of the system to use these classes, as they can simply import the UserModule and access the classes that they need.
