# Common Reuse Principle (CRP)

The common reuse principle is a software design principle that states that modules or components that are frequently used together should be designed to work together seamlessly. This means that related components should be designed to be compatible with each other and to have a consistent and intuitive interface, so that they can be easily combined and used together in a variety of contexts.

Here is an example of the common reuse principle in TypeScript:

```typescript
// A module for managing user accounts

// An interface for representing a user
export interface User {
  username: string;
  password: string;
  // ...
}

// A class for managing user authentication
export class UserAuth {
  // Check if a user is authenticated
  public static isAuthenticated(user: User): boolean {
    // ...
  }

  // Authenticate a user
  public static authenticate(user: User): boolean {
    // ...
  }
}

// A class for managing user sessions
export class UserSession {
  // Start a new user session
  public static start(user: User): string {
    // ...
  }

  // Check if a user has an active session
  public static hasActiveSession(user: User): boolean {
    // ...
  }

  // End a user session
  public static end(user: User) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

In this example, the UserAuth and UserSession classes are designed to work together seamlessly. Both classes accept a User object as an input, and they use the same properties (username and password) to identify and authenticate the user. This makes it easy to combine and use these classes together in other parts of the system, as they have a consistent and
