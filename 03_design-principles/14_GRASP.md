# GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles)

GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles) is a set of
software design principles that provide guidance on how to assign responsibility
for different aspects of a software system. GRASP is based on the idea that good
software design involves assigning the appropriate responsibility for each part
of the system, and that this can help to create software that is easy to
understand, maintain, and modify.

GRASP consists of nine principles that can be applied to the design of software
systems. These principles are:

1. **Information Expert**: Assign responsibility to the class that has the most
   information or knowledge about a particular task.

2. GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles): Assign
   responsibility for creating an object to the class that will use the object.

3. **Low Coupling**: Minimize the dependencies between classes and modules.

4. **High Cohesion**: Maximize the functional cohesion within a class or module.

5. **Controller**: Assign responsibility for controlling the flow of a system to
   a central class or module.

6. **Pure Fabrication**: Create new classes or modules to handle
   responsibilities that cannot be assigned to existing classes or modules.

7. **Indirection**: Use indirection to reduce dependencies between classes and
   modules.

8. **Protected Variations**: Use inheritance or other techniques to protect
   against changes in the requirements of a system.

9. **Polymorphism**: Use polymorphism to provide a consistent interface for
   similar classes or modules.

By applying the GRASP principles to the design of your software systems, you can
create software that is well-structured, maintainable, and easy to understand.
This can help to improve the overall quality and reliability of your software
