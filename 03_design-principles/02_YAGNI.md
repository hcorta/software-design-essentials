# YAGNI Principle

The YAGNI principle is a design guideline that states that you should not write
code that you don't currently need. The acronym YAGNI stands for "You Aren't
Gonna Need It," and it emphasizes the importance of avoiding unnecessary
complexity in your code.

The YAGNI principle is based on the idea that it is often difficult to predict
the future needs of a software project. As a result, it is often tempting to
write code that is "future-proof" or that anticipates potential future
requirements. However, this can lead to unnecessary complexity and can make it
harder to maintain your code in the long run.

To follow the YAGNI principle in your software development, you should focus on
writing only the code that is necessary to solve the problem at hand. This means
avoiding the temptation to write "extra" code that you think you might need in
the future, and instead focusing on delivering the minimum amount of code that
is required to meet the current requirements.

By following the YAGNI principle, you can avoid adding unnecessary complexity to
your code, and you can focus on creating solutions that are simple, elegant, and
easy to understand. This can make your code more maintainable and easier to work
with over time. Additionally, by avoiding the need to write "extra" code, you
can save time and effort, and you can focus on delivering value to your users
more quickly.

In summary, the YAGNI principle is a design guideline that emphasizes the
importance of avoiding unnecessary complexity in your code. By following the
YAGNI principle, you can create code that is simple, maintainable, and focused
on delivering value to your users.
