# Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle

The Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle is a design guideline that states that a program should be divided into different sections or modules, each dealing with a specific concern or responsibility. This means that you should avoid mixing different concerns or responsibilities in a single class or module, and instead create separate classes or modules for each concern or responsibility.

The SoC principle is based on the idea that mixing different concerns or responsibilities in a single class or module can make your code more difficult to understand and maintain. This is because different concerns or responsibilities often have different requirements, and mixing them together can make it harder to satisfy those requirements. Additionally, mixing different concerns or responsibilities can make your code more complex and difficult to work with, as you may need to understand multiple concerns or responsibilities in order to make a change.

To follow the SoC principle in your software development, you should divide your program into different sections or modules, each dealing with a specific concern or responsibility. This means identifying the different concerns or responsibilities in your program, and creating separate classes or modules for each concern or responsibility. By doing this, you can make your code more modular and maintainable, and you can make it easier to understand and work with.

One way to ensure that your code follows the SoC principle is to use the Separation of Concerns Principle Checklist. This checklist provides a set of guidelines for dividing your code into different sections or modules, each dealing with a specific concern or responsibility. By following these guidelines, you can create code that is more modular, maintainable, and easy to understand.
