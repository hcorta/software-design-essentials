# Factory Pattern

The factory pattern is a design pattern that is used in software development to
create objects. The factory pattern provides a way to create objects without
specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This allows the code
to be more flexible and reusable, as the same factory can be used to create
different types of objects based on the needs of the application.

In the factory pattern, a factory class is responsible for creating objects.
This factory class has a method, typically called create, that is used to create
new objects. The create method takes some input, such as the type of object to
be created, and then uses that input to determine which class of object to
create and how to initialize the object.

Here is an example of the factory pattern implemented in TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Product {
  doSomething(): void
}

class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
  doSomething() {
    console.log('I am a concrete product of type A')
  }
}

class ConcreteProductB implements Product {
  doSomething() {
    console.log('I am a concrete product of type B')
  }
}

class ProductFactory {
  static createProduct(type: string): Product {
    switch (type) {
      case 'A':
        return new ConcreteProductA()
      case 'B':
        return new ConcreteProductB()
      default:
        throw new Error('Invalid product type')
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const productA = ProductFactory.createProduct('A')
productA.doSomething() // Outputs: "I am a concrete product of type A"

const productB = ProductFactory.createProduct('B')
productB.doSomething() // Outputs: "I am a concrete product of type B"
```

In this example, the ProductFactory class defines a factory that is used to
create Product objects. The Product interface defines the behavior that all
products must implement, and the ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB classes
define concrete implementations of the Product interface. The ProductFactory
class has a createProduct method that is used to create new Product objects.
This method takes a type parameter that specifies which type of product to
create, and then returns the appropriate product based on that type.

To use the factory pattern, a client would call the createProduct method of the
ProductFactory class, passing in the type of product they want to create. The
factory will then create and return the appropriate product object, which the
client can use to access the functionality of the product. This allows the
client to create new objects without having to know the specific implementation
details of the objects that are being created.
