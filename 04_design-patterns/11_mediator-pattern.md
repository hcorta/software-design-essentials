# Mediator Pattern

The mediator pattern is a design pattern that is used in software development to define a object that acts as a central hub for communication between other objects in a system. The mediator pattern is often used to reduce the coupling between objects, allowing them to communicate with each other in a loosely-coupled way.

In the mediator pattern, the mediator object is responsible for managing the communication between other objects in the system. These other objects are called colleagues, and they communicate with the mediator rather than directly with each other. This allows the mediator to control the flow of communication and ensure that the colleagues are able to interact in a predictable and consistent manner.
