# Proxy pattern

The proxy pattern is a design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder object that controls access to another object. This can be useful in situations where it is necessary to control or modify the behavior of an object when it is accessed.

To implement the proxy pattern in TypeScript, you would create a proxy class that holds a reference to the original object, and provides methods that delegate requests to the original object. These methods can add additional behavior before or after delegating the request to the original object.

Here is an example of a Proxy class that provides a proxy for a Subject class:

```typescript
class Subject {
  public request(): void {
    // The original request behavior goes here...
  }
}

class Proxy {
  private subject: Subject;

  constructor(subject: Subject) {
    this.subject = subject;
  }

  public request(): void {
    // Additional behavior can be added before or after
    // delegating the request to the subject...
    this.subject.request();
  }
}
```

In this example, the Proxy class holds a reference to an instance of the Subject class, and provides a request() method that delegates requests to the Subject instance. This allows the Proxy to control or modify the behavior of the Subject when it is accessed through the Proxy.
