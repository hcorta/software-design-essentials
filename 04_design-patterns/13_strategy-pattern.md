# Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern is a software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

Here is an example of the strategy pattern implemented in TypeScript:

```typescript
// The interface defining the algorithm's behavior.
interface Strategy {
  execute(): void;
}

// One concrete implementation of the algorithm.
class ConcreteStrategyA implements Strategy {
  execute() {
    // ...
  }
}

// Another concrete implementation of the algorithm.
class ConcreteStrategyB implements Strategy {
  execute() {
    // ...
  }
}

// The context class maintains a reference to a strategy object and
// uses it to execute the algorithm.
class Context {
  private strategy: Strategy;

  constructor(strategy: Strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  setStrategy(strategy: Strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  executeStrategy() {
    this.strategy.execute();
  }
}
```

In this example, the Context class maintains a reference to a Strategy object and uses it to execute an algorithm. The Strategy interface defines the behavior that all concrete strategy classes must implement, and the ConcreteStrategyA and ConcreteStrategyB classes are two examples of classes that implement this behavior in different ways. The Context class allows the strategy to be selected at runtime by providing a method for setting the strategy object. This allows the behavior of the algorithm to be changed dynamically.
