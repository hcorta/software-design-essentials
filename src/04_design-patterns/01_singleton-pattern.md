# Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures that a class has only one
instance, and provides a global point of access to it. This can be useful when
only one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

To implement the singleton pattern in TypeScript, you would create a class with
a static method that returns the same instance of the class each time it is
called. Here is an example:

```typescript
class Singleton {
  private static instance: Singleton

  private constructor() {}

  public static getInstance(): Singleton {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton()
    }
    return Singleton.instance
  }
}
```

To use this class, you would call the getInstance() method, which will return
the same instance of the Singleton class every time it is called. This ensures
that only one instance of the Singleton class exists at any given time.
