# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is a design guideline that states that a class
should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that you
should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its existing
code.

The OCP is based on the idea that code that is easy to modify is often more
difficult to maintain and reuse than code that is difficult to modify. This is
because modifying existing code can often introduce new bugs or break existing
functionality, which can make your code more difficult to work with over time.
Additionally, modifying existing code can make it more difficult to understand
and work with, as it may require you to understand the details of the original
implementation in order to make changes.

To follow the OCP in your software development, you should design your classes
so that they are easy to extend without requiring modifications to the existing
code. This is typically achieved through the use of abstraction and
polymorphism, which allow you to create new classes that inherit the behavior
and properties of existing classes, and that can be used in place of those
existing classes without breaking any existing code.

One way to ensure that your classes follow the OCP is to use the Open/Closed
Principle Checklist. This checklist provides a set of guidelines for designing
classes that are open for extension and closed for modification. By following
these guidelines, you can create classes that are more flexible and adaptable,
and that will be easier to maintain and reuse over time.
