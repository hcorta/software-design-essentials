# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for writing object-oriented code.
They were first introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob," in
his book "Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices." The
SOLID principles are intended to help developers write code that is easy to
maintain, extend, and reuse.

The acronym SOLID stands for five principles, which are:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have one, and only one,
   reason to change. This means that a class should have a single, well-defined
   responsibility, and should not be responsible for multiple things. This helps
   to make your code more modular and easier to maintain, as changes to one part
   of the code will not affect other parts of the code.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension, but closed
   for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the behavior
   of a class without modifying its existing code. This is achieved through the
   use of abstraction and polymorphism, which allow you to add new functionality
   without changing the existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes should be substitutable
   for their base classes. This means that you should be able to use a derived
   class in place of a base class without affecting the correctness of your
   program. This is achieved through the use of inheritance, where derived
   classes inherit the properties and behavior of their base classes.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend
   on methods they do not use. This means that you should avoid creating large,
   monolithic interfaces that require clients to implement many methods that
   they may not need. Instead, you should create small, specific interfaces that
   only include the methods that are relevant to a particular client.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on
   low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions. This means that you
   should avoid creating dependencies between your high-level and low-level
   modules. Instead, you should use abstraction to decouple your modules, so
   that they can depend on each other through well-defined interfaces.

In summary, the SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for writing
object-oriented code that is easy to maintain, extend, and reuse. By following
these principles, you can create code that is more modular, flexible, and
adaptable, and that will be easier to work with over time.
